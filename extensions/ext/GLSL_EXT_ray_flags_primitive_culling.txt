Dependencies

    This extension can be applied to OpenGL GLSL versions 4.60
    (#version 460) and higher.

    This extension is written against revision 5 of the OpenGL Shading Language
    version 4.60, dated September 4, 2017.

    This extension interacts with GL_EXT_ray_tracing.

    This extension interacts with GL_EXT_ray_query.

Overview

    This extension document modifies GLSL to add additional integer constants
    which can be used as ray flags under ray tracing or ray query extensions.
    

    This extension document adds support for the following extensions to be used
    within GLSL:

    - GL_EXT_ray_flags_primitive_culling - 

    Mapping to SPIR-V
    -----------------

    For informational purposes (non-normative), the following is an
    expected way for an implementation to map GLSL constructs to SPIR-V
    constructs:

      gl_RayFlagsSkipTrianglesEXT -> SkipTrianglesKHR ray flag
      gl_RayFlagsSkipAABBEXT -> SkipAABBsKHR ray flag

    Using this extension defines the <RayTraversalPrimitiveCullingProvisionalKHR> 
    capability.

Modifications to the OpenGL Shading Language Specification, Version 4.60

    Including the following line in a shader can be used to control the
    language features described in this extension:

      #extension GL_EXT_ray_flags_primitive_culling : <behavior>

    where <behavior> is as specified in section 3.3.
    New preprocessor #defines are added:

      #define GL_EXT_ray_flags_primtive_culling          1


Additions to Chapter 7 of the OpenGL Shading Language Specification
(Built-in Variables)

    Modify Section 7.3, Built-in Constants

    Add a new subsection 7.3.x, "Fixed Constants"

    The following constants are provided in all shader stages when this
    extension is enabled

    const uint gl_RayFlagsSkipTrianglesEXT = 256U;
    const uint gl_RayFlagsSkipAABBEXT = 512U;


Interactions with GL_EXT_ray_tracing/GL_EXT_ray_query

    Ray flags added by this extension can be used as flags for 'rayflags'
    argument for  traceRayEXT()/rayQueryInitializeEXT() call or for comparing 
    values to gl_IncomingRayFlagsEXT or the result of rayQueryGetRayFlagsEXT.

Issues

    TBD
